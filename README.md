### Hy ðŸ‘‹
I am a third-year information systems student at Hasanuddin University. I have developed my skills in IT and programming, I have a particular interest in mobile application development with flutter and machine learning system development. I understand the use of programming languages such as Python, Java, and Dart. I also have a bit of a knack for UI design to build my apps. I feel challenged and excited to learn new things.
